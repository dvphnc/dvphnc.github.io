# ☁️ Cloud and Virtualization Fundamentals

The ***cloud*** refers to a network of servers that provide storage, software, and computing resources over the internet. Instead of owning hardware, users rent computing resources, gaining flexibility and scalability while reducing infrastructure costs.  

### **Virtualization**

***Virtualization*** enables multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine using a *hypervisor*. The hypervisor allocates CPU, memory, and storage resources to each *virtual machine (VM)*, creating isolated environments that operate independently. This improves resource efficiency and system management.  

### **Cloud Storage

*Cloud storage* allows data to be stored and accessed remotely through the internet. It supports documents, backups, and system images, ensuring availability and reducing reliance on local storage devices.  

### **Deployment Models**

-  **Public Cloud:** Shared resources available to multiple users (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).  
-  **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization with greater control and privacy.  
-  **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds for balanced flexibility, control, and cost efficiency.  

### **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**

A CASB operates between users and cloud services to:

-  Monitor data movement  
-  Enforce security policies  
-  Detect and mitigate threats  
-  Ensure compliance with standards  

It strengthens cloud environments by providing visibility and control over data usage.  

> Though the term “cloud” sounds abstract, it represents complex infrastructures powered by virtualization and secured by layered defenses. Together, they make modern computing flexible, efficient, and secure.
