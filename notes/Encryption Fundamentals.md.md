# 🔐 Encryption Fundamentals

***Encryption*** converts readable information into *ciphertext*, which can only be accessed using the correct *key*. This process ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and trust across digital communications.  

### **Principles of Cryptography**

These principles define how data is protected, transformed, and verified. They establish the foundation for secure communication through confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.  

### **Core Components**

**Hash Functions, Ciphers, and Key Exchange Algorithms** are essential to cryptographic systems.  

  -  *Hash functions* generate unique representations of data for verification.  
  -  *Ciphers* encrypt and decrypt information using mathematical operations.  
  -  *Key exchange algorithms* enable secure sharing of encryption keys between parties.  

### **Cryptography in Internet Security**

Modern internet communication relies on encryption to protect data in transit. Secure websites, online transactions, and private messages use cryptographic algorithms to ensure confidentiality and authenticity.  

### **End-to-End vs. Transport Encryption**

-  *End-to-end encryption* ensures that only communicating parties can read messages.  
-  *Transport encryption* secures data only during transmission between systems.  

Understanding these layers helps identify potential points of vulnerability.  

### **Certificate Authorities and Digital Trust**

-  **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**, **Trusted Root-CAs**, and **X.509 Certificates** validate identities and issue digital certificates.  

These entities create a chain of trust, ensuring that users can confirm the legitimacy of websites and services.  

> Encryption not only hides information but also builds digital trust and security. It is a fundamental pillar of privacy and safe communication in the modern internet.
